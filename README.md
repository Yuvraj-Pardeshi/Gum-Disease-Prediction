# Dental Clinic Management System

The Dental Clinic Management System is a powerful desktop application designed to streamline dental practice management. Built using Python and Tkinter, it offers a sleek graphical user interface for effortless navigation. This comprehensive system incorporates advanced technologies such as TensorFlow and Keras to develop Convolutional Neural Network models for accurate prediction of gum disease characteristics. With features including patient record management, image analysis of gums, and seamless database implementation using SQLite, dentists can efficiently manage clinic workflow and enhance patient care. The application is packaged as an executable (.exe) file for easy download and use, ensuring convenience for dentists seeking to optimize their clinic operations.


## Features

- **Tech Stack**: Python, Tkinter, TensorFlow, Keras, CNN, SQLite.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Developed a sleek and intuitive GUI   application using Python and Tkinter, offering seamless navigation and a delightful user experience.
- **Patient Record Management**: Effortlessly manage patient records, including comprehensive details and treatment histories, to ensure personalized care and efficient treatment planning.
- **Database Implementation**: Implemented a robust SQLite database for seamless data storage and retrieval, optimizing clinic workflow and ensuring data integrity.
- **Image Analysis** - Build my own CNN model, which has been trained on multiple gum disease images to efficiently detect the disease.
- **Prediction of Key Features**: Trained CNN models to predict crucial gum disease features such as color (pink or red), calculus presence, interdental papilla enlargement, and contour (swollen or normal), facilitating precise diagnoses and tailored treatment plans.
- **Executable Conversion**: Converted the application to an executable (.exe) file using cx_Freeze and NSIS EXE bundler, enabling dentists to easily download and use it as a desktop application without any hassle.
